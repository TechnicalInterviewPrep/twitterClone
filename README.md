## System Design Challenge

“Design a simplified version of Twitter where people can post tweets, follow other people and favorite tweets.”

## Clarifying Questions

If you're working through this problem by yourself or doing a mock interview with a friend, these are the answers that the interviewer would give to the following questions:

*Q: How many users do we expect this system to handle?*
*A: You can expect to have 10 million users generating 100 million requests per day.*

*Q: How many other users will the average person be following?*
*A: We expect that each user will be following 200 other users on average, but expect some extraordinary users with tens of thousands of followers.*

*Q: How many new tweets and new favorites can we expect each day?*
*A: We expect that there will be a maximum of 10 million tweets per day and each tweet will probably be favorited twice on average but again, expect some big outliers.*
